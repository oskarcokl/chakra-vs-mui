# Chakra vs MUI

This is a simple project to test out how building different components works in
both of these UI libraries.

| Component                         | Chakra | MUI  |
|-----------------------------------|--------|------|
| Login form                        |   ✅   |  ✅  |
| Register form                     |   ✅   |  ✅  |
| Expense input form                |   ✅   |  ✅  |
| Confirmation modal                |   ✅   |  ✅  |
| Success toast                     |   ✅   |  ✅  |
| Responsive navbar                 |   ✅   |  ✅  |
| Table with sorting and pagination |   ✅   |  ✅  |


# Comparison

## Chakra

### Initial Setup
This was kinda weird tbh. I am using chakra 3 which I guess is a bit newer. I
followed their docs on how to set it up but it looks like the docs are ment for
a Next.js setup even though they have a seperate documentation page just for that.
Either way after some hacking and choice words I got the whole thing working.
After that the initial usage was a breeze.
