# Chakra vs MUI

This is a simple project to test out how building different components works in both of these UI libraries

| Component                         | Chakra | MUI |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----|
| Login form                        | [ ]    | [ ] |
| Register form                     | [ ]    | [ ] |
| Expense input form                | [ ]    | [ ] |
| Confirmation modal                | [ ]    | [ ] |
| Success toast                     | [ ]    | [ ] |
| Responsive navbar                 | [ ]    | [ ] |
